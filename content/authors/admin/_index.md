**Tao Sun** *(in Chinese: 孙韬)* is currently pursuing his Master's Degree of Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), Switzerland. Prior to that, he has graduated from [Tongji University](www.tongji.edu.cn), Shanghai, China, with the Bachelor's Degree of Software Engineering. He has been closely working with [Prof. Yin Wang](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~yinw/) of the [Deep Learning Lab](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1153/6621.htm) of Tongji University for nearly two years, and with Research Scientist [Dr. Saikat Basu](http://www.csc.lsu.edu/~saikat/) and [Dr. Guan Pang](https://research.fb.com/people/pang-guan/) of [Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com/) for nine months on the research of Computer Vision. He has published 3 papers as the first author, including CVPR 2019, CVPRW 2018, ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop 2018. 

Currently, he is working on semi-supervised learning of image segmentation, and structure-aware image recognition. His research interests mainly lie in the fields of the intersection of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. For more information, please see the [CV (PDF)](files/CV_suntao.pdf).
